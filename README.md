## key-harmony

Play a sound every time you press a key, some people like it.

Right now it plays a default sound hardcoded but later will be selectable. The default sound is the mechanical cherry mx brown key stroke.

## How to run

On Linux/MacOS

```bash
nohup python key_sound.py &
```

On Windows

```cmd
pythonw job.py
```

## TODO's

- [ ] Add a `-k` arg to kill the current process
- [ ] Add more sounds, all mechanical cherry sounds
- [ ] Add `-file` arg to use a custom sound
- [ ] Add `-option` arg to select one of the default sounds
- [ ] User interface?
